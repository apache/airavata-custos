Apache Airavata Custos is an open-source security framework designed to address the challenges of **identity and access management (IAM)** in distributed and collaborative environments. Initially tailored for science gateways, Custos provides a comprehensive suite of security operations, including **authentication**, **authorization**, **group management**, and **secrets management**, ensuring secure access to resources and sensitive data.

Custos equips applications with the tools to manage user identities and enforce access policies efficiently, making it an ideal solution for environments with diverse user bases and complex security needs. By supporting **federated authentication**, **dynamic group membership**, and **group-based access control**, Custos bridges the gap between verifying user identities and defining what users are allowed to do. Its **language-independent APIs** enable seamless integration with applications across various ecosystems.

### Key Features
- **Identity and Access Management**: Centralized management of authentication, authorization, and group-based access controls.
- **Federated Authentication**: Integrates with external identity providers like CILogon, institutional login systems, and protocols like SAML and OpenID Connect.
- **Dynamic Authorization**: Supports group-based access control (GBAC), role-based access control (RBAC), and attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained, context-aware permissions.
- **Group and Tenant Management**: Enables automated group membership and multi-tenant support for flexible, application-specific configurations.
- **Secrets Management**: Secures sensitive credentials with HashiCorp Vault, ensuring safe and compliant resource management.
- **Extensible Integration**: Offers REST APIs, Java SDK, and Python SDK for integration with external applications and workflows.

Custos serves both as a robust, open-source IAM solution for the science gateway community and a framework adaptable to any collaborative or distributed application ecosystem. By addressing IAM challenges with scalability and security at its core, Custos empowers organizations to operate with confidence in increasingly interconnected environments.

## Quickstart

## Installation Instructions

### Setup Custos for local development

#### Prerequisites

* Java 17

* Docker installed on local environment 

* Maven 3.6.x

#### Clone the repository
  ```
    git clone -b develop https://github.com/apache/airavata-custos.git
    
  ```

#### Build source code
  
  Following  command builds the Custos source code and create two docker images of custos_core_server and custos_integration_server
  
  ```
    cd airavata-custos
    mvn clean install
  ```
  
#### Run Custos on docker
  
Following command starts Custos main services and its depend services. All services are listed below and you should be able to
access them locally if all services are correctly started.

  - Dependent Services
    * Keycloak (http://localhost:8080/auth/)
    * MySQL (0.0.0.0:3306)
    * HashiCorp Vault (http://localhost:8201/)
    * CILogon (Not available for local development)
    
  - Custos Services
    * Custos Core Service (0.0.0.0:7001 (grpc port))
    * Custos Integration Service (0.0.0.0:7000 (grpc port))
    * Custos Rest Proxy (http://localhost:10000(envoy proxy)
    
  ```
     cd custos-utilities/ide-integration/src/main/containers
     docker-compose up
  ```

#### Bootstrapping Custos  Super Tenant
  
If all services were successfully ran. Custos bootstrap service needs to be run to create a  Super tenant to launch Custos Portal
   ```
    cd custos-utilities/custos-bootstrap-service/
    mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
The above command should create the super tenant and it outputs super tenant credentials. Copy those credentials to configure
Custos Portal.

```
Note: Make sure to clean up old databases for fresh start.
```

#### Install Custos Portal Locally

Follow the following link to access portal deployment instructions

[Custos Portal](https://github.com/apache/airavata-custos-portal/blob/master/README.md)

You have to configure following properties in the .env file

```
CUSTOS_CLIENT_ID="SUPERT TENANT ID CREATED FROM ABOVE STEP"
CUSTOS_CLIENT_SEC="SUPERT TENANT CREDENTIAL CREATED FROM ABOVE STEP"
CUSTOS_API_URL="http://localhost:10000"
CUSTOS_SUPER_CLIENT_ID="SUPERT TENANT ID CREATED FROM ABOVE STEP"
UNDER_MAINTENANCE=False
```

## Custos Integration With External Applications
Custos can be integrated with external applications using Custos REST Endpoints, Python SDK, or Java SDK.

### Integrate Using Java SDK
In order to perform this operation you need to have a already activated tenant in either Custos Managed Services or Your own deployment.
Following instructions are given for locally deployed custos setup which can be extended to any deployment,

####Initializing Custos Java SDK

* Add maven dependency to your project
```<dependency>
   <groupId>org.apache.custos</groupId>
   <artifactId>custos-java-sdk</artifactId>
   <version>1.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

* Initialize Custos Client Provider in your application
```
 CustosClientProvider custosClientProvider = new CustosClientProvider.Builder().setServerHost("localhost")
                    .setServerPort(7000)
                    .setClientId(CUSTOS CLIENT ID) // client Id generated from above step or any active tenant id
                    .setClientSec(CUSTOS CLIENT SECRET)  
                    .usePlainText(true) // Don't use this in production setup
                    .build();
```
Once above step is done, you can use custos available methods for  authentication and authorization purposes
* Sample client code to register and enable a User

```
 UserManagementClient userManagementClient =  custosClientProvider.getUserManagementClient();
 userManagementClient.registerUser("jhon","Smith","testpassword","smith@1",
                    "jhon@email.com",false);
 userManagementClient.enableUser("jhon");
 OperationStatus status =  userManagementClient.isUserEnabled("Jhon");
```
##### 
### Deploy Custos on remote server
