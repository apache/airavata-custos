# This is the configuration template for ansible-test Tower integration tests.
#
# You do not need this template if you are:
#
# 1) Running integration tests without using ansible-test.
# 2) Using the automatically provisioned Tower credentials in ansible-test.
#
# If you do not want to use the automatically provisioned temporary Tower credentials,
# fill in the @VAR placeholders below and save this file without the .template extension.
# This will cause ansible-test to use the given configuration instead of temporary credentials.
#
# NOTE: Automatic provisioning of Tower credentials requires an ansible-core-ci API key.
