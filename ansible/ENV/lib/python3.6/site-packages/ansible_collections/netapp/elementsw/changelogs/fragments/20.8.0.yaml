minor_changes:
  - na_elementsw_drive - add all drives in a cluster, allow for a list of nodes or a list of drives.
  - use a three group format for ``version_added``.  So 2.7 becomes 2.7.0.  Same thing for 2.8 and 2.9.
  - add "type:str" (or int, dict) where missing in documentation section.
  - add "required:true" where missing.
  - remove "required:true" for state and use present as default.
