  - netapp-lib 2020.3.12 is strongly recommended as it provides better error reporting for connection issues.
  - A physical or virtual clustered Data ONTAP system. The modules support Data ONTAP 9.1 and onward.
  - REST support requires ONTAP 9.6 or later.
  - To enable http on the cluster you must run the following commands 'set -privilege advanced;' 'system services web modify -http-enabled true;'

notes:
  - The modules prefixed with na\\_ontap are built to support the ONTAP storage platform.
