## Releasing

### Prepare a new release

The changelog is managed using the `antsibull` tool. You can install
it using `pip install antsibull`

1. Update version in galaxy.yml
2. Update changelog using antsibull
```
antsibull-changelog release
```
3. Commit changelog and new version
```
git commit -m "Release version X.Y.Z" galaxy.yml CHANGELOG.rst changelogs/
```
4. Tag the release. Preferably create GPG signed tag if you have a GPG
key. Version tags should be prefixed with "v" (otherwise the
integration tests won't run automatically).
```
git tag -s -m "Version X.Y.Z" vX.Y.Z
```
5. Push the release and tag
```
git push origin master vX.Y.Z
```

### Release to Ansible Galaxy

After the release is tagged and pushed to Github a release to Ansible
Galaxy can be created using the release feature in Github:

1. **Wait for integration tests to succeed. They should automatically
run on new tags.** Only release if they succeed. Otherwise delete the
tag and fix the issue.
2. Create a release on Github by going to the release overview and
   selecting "Draft a new release".
