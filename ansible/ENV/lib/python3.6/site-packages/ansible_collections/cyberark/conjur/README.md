## Requirements

- An instance of [CyberArk Conjur Open Source](https://www.conjur.org) v1.x+ or [CyberArk Dynamic
  Access
  Provider](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/AAM-DAP/Latest/en/Content/Resources/_TopNav/cc_Home.htm)
  v10.x+ accessible from the target node
- Ansible >= 2.9

## Using ansible-conjur-collection with Conjur OSS

Are you using this project with [Conjur OSS](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur)? Then we
**strongly** recommend choosing the version of this project to use from the latest [Conjur OSS
suite release](https://docs.conjur.org/Latest/en/Content/Overview/Conjur-OSS-Suite-Overview.html).
Conjur maintainers perform additional testing on the suite release versions to ensure
compatibility. When possible, upgrade your Conjur version to match the
[latest suite release](https://docs.conjur.org/Latest/en/Content/ReleaseNotes/ConjurOSS-suite-RN.htm);
when using integrations, choose the latest suite release that matches your Conjur version. For any
questions, please contact us on [Discourse](https://discuss.cyberarkcommons.org/c/conjur/5).

## Installation 

From terminal, run the following command:
```sh
ansible-galaxy collection install cyberark.conjur
```

## Conjur Ansible Role

This Ansible role provides the ability to grant Conjur machine identity to a host. Based on that
identity, secrets can then be retrieved securely using the [Conjur Lookup
Plugin](#conjur-ansible-lookup-plugin) or using the [Summon](https://github.com/cyberark/summon)
tool (installed on hosts with identities created by this role).

### Usage

The Conjur role provides a method to establish the Conjur identity of a remote node with Ansible.
The node can then be granted least-privilege access to retrieve the secrets it needs in a secure
manner.

### Role Variables

* `conjur_appliance_url` _(Optional)_: URL of the running Conjur service
* `conjur_account` _(Optional)_: Conjur account name
* `conjur_host_factory_token` _(Optional)_: [Host
  Factory](https://developer.conjur.net/reference/services/host_factory/) token for layer
  enrollment. This should be specified in the environment on the Ansible controlling host.
* `conjur_host_name` _(Optional)_: Name of the host to be created.
* `conjur_ssl_certificate`: Public SSL certificate of the Conjur endpoint
* `conjur_validate_certs`: Boolean value to indicate if the Conjur endpoint should validate
  certificates
* `summon.version`: version of Summon to install. Default is `0.8.2`.
* `summon_conjur.version`: version of Summon-Conjur provider to install. Default is `0.5.3`.

The variables marked with _`(Optional)`_ are not required fields. All other variables are required
for running with an HTTPS Conjur endpoint.

### Example Playbook

Configure a remote node with a Conjur identity and Summon:
```yml
- hosts: servers
  roles:
    - role: cyberark.conjur.conjur-host-identity
      conjur_appliance_url: 'https://conjur.myorg.com',
      conjur_account: 'myorg',
      conjur_host_factory_token: "{{ lookup('env', 'HFTOKEN') }}",
      conjur_host_name: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
      conjur_ssl_certificate: "{{ lookup('file', '/path/to/conjur.pem') }}"
      conjur_validate_certs: yes
```

This example:
- Registers the host `{{ inventory_hostname }}` with Conjur, adding it into the Conjur policy layer
  defined for the provided host factory token.
- Installs Summon with the Summon Conjur provider for secret retrieval from Conjur.

### Summon & Service Managers

With Summon installed, using Conjur with a Service Manager (like systemd) becomes a snap.  Here's a
simple example of a `systemd` file connecting to Conjur:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=DemoApp
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=DemoUser
#Environment=CONJUR_MAJOR_VERSION=4
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/summon --yaml 'DB_PASSWORD: !var staging/demoapp/database/password' /usr/local/bin/myapp
```

> Note: When connecting to Conjur 4 (Conjur Enterprise), Summon requires the environment variable
`CONJUR_MAJOR_VERSION` set to `4`. You can provide it by uncommenting the relevant line above.

The above example uses Summon to retrieve the password stored in `staging/myapp/database/password`,
set it to an environment variable `DB_PASSWORD`, and provide it to the demo application process.
Using Summon, the secret is kept off disk. If the service is restarted, Summon retrieves the
password as the application is started.

### Recommendations

- Add `no_log: true` to each play that uses sensitive data, otherwise that data can be printed to
  the logs.

- Set the Ansible files to minimum permissions. Ansible uses the permissions of the user that runs
  it.

## Conjur Ansible Lookup Plugin

Fetch credentials from CyberArk Conjur using the controlling host's Conjur identity or environment
variables.

The controlling host running Ansible must have a Conjur identity, provided for example by the
[ConjurAnsible role](#conjur-ansible-role).

### Environment variables

The following environment variables will be used by the lookup plugin to authenticate with the
Conjur host, if they are present on the system running the lookup plugin.

- `CONJUR_ACCOUNT` : The Conjur account name
- `CONJUR_APPLIANCE_URL` : URL of the running Conjur service
- `CONJUR_CERT_FILE` : Path to the Conjur certificate file
- `CONJUR_AUTHN_LOGIN` : A valid Conjur host username
- `CONJUR_AUTHN_API_KEY` : The api key that corresponds to the Conjur host username
- `CONJUR_AUTHN_TOKEN_FILE` : Path to a file containing a valid Conjur auth token

### Role Variables

None.

### Examples

#### Retrieve a secret in a Playbook
 
```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
  - name: Lookup variable in Conjur
    debug:
      msg: "{{ lookup('cyberark.conjur.conjur_variable', '/path/to/secret') }}"
```

#### Retrieve a private key in an Inventory file

```yaml
---
ansible_host: <host>
ansible_ssh_private_key_file: "{{ lookup('cyberark.conjur.conjur_variable', 'path/to/secret-id', as_file=True) }}"
```

**Note:** Using the `as_file=True` condition, the private key is stored in a temporary file and its path is written 
in `ansible_ssh_private_key_file`.
