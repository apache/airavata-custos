## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2020-12-29

### Added
- The [Conjur Ansible role](https://galaxy.ansible.com/cyberark/conjur-host-identity) has been
  migrated to this collection, where it will be maintained moving forward.
  At current, the role in the collection is aligned with the v0.3.2 release of
  the standalone role.
  [cyberark/ansible-conjur-host-identity#30](https://github.com/cyberark/ansible-conjur-host-identity/issues/30)
- Add `as_file` boolean option to the lookup plugin which stores the secret as
  a temporary file and returns its path. This enables users to use the
  `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` parameter to define an SSH private key using a
  variable stored in Conjur; previously, users couldn't set this parameter via
  a direct call to the lookup plugin because the parameter does not accept
  inline SSH keys, and the lookup plugin could only return a string.

  [Cyberark Commons post #1070](https://discuss.cyberarkcommons.org/t/conjur-ansible-lookup-plugin-and-ssh-key-file/1070) 

## [1.0.7] - 2020-08-20

### Changed
- Various improvements to code quality, documentation, and adherence to Ansible standards
  in preparation for including this collection in the release of Ansible 2.10.
  [cyberark/ansible-conjur-collection#30](https://github.com/cyberark/ansible-conjur-collection/issues/30)

## [1.0.6] - 2020-07-01

### Added
- Plugin supports authenticating with Conjur access token (for example, if provided by authn-k8s).
  [cyberark/ansible-conjur-collection#23](https://github.com/cyberark/ansible-conjur-collection/issues/23)

## [1.0.5] - 2020-06-18

### Added
- Plugin supports validation of self-signed certificates provided in `CONJUR_CERT_FILE`
  or Conjur config file
  ([cyberark/ansible-conjur-collection#4](https://github.com/cyberark/ansible-conjur-collection/issues/4))

### Fixed
- Encode spaces to "%20" instead of "+". This encoding fixes an issue where Conjur
  variables that have spaces were not encoded correctly 
  ([cyberark/ansible-conjur-collection#12](https://github.com/cyberark/ansible-conjur-collection/issues/12))
- Allow users to set `validate_certs` to `false` without setting a value to `cert_file`
  ([cyberark/ansible-conjur-collection#13](https://github.com/cyberark/ansible-conjur-collection/issues/13))

## [1.0.3] - 2020-04-18
### Changed
- Updated documentation section to comply with sanity checks

## [1.0.2] - 2020-04-01
### Added
- Migrated code from Ansible conjur_variable lookup plugin
- Added support to configure the use of the plugin via environment variables
