NetApp E-Series SANtricity Collection
=========
    The SANtricity collection consist of the latest available versions of the NetApp E-Series SANtricity modules and roles.

        This collection provides NetApp E-Series customers with a wide range of configuration options through the collection's modules. However, the real
    benefit of using the SANtricity collection is found in the host and management roles. These roles provide ready-made, policy-based orchestration for
    E-Series platforms based on predefined role variables.
        Once the physical hardware has been installed, the SANtricity roles are capable of discovering the DHCP-assigned addresses, setting initial passwords
    and management interfaces so your automation can do full deployments for you without logging directly into the devices. Yet that's just the beginning,
    the management role will also ensure alerts, ASUP, logging, LDAP, and firmware are configured as expected; and the host role will setup host interfaces,
    provision and map storage, and if your servers are defined in the inventory, correctly populate E-Series hosts and host groups automatically.

Storage System Credentials
--------------------------
    Proxy:
        - The proxy's credentials should be defined at the group inventory level (eseries_proxy_api_url, eseries_proxy_api_password, eseries_subnet) and each storage system host inventory file should include its password (eseries_system_password) and the system's serial number (eseries_system_serial).
        - You can substitute a unique proxy storage system identifier (eseries_proxy_ssid) for the system's serial number if the system has already been added to the proxy. However, using the storage system serial number is the preferred method since it will never change and is always known to the system. If you would like to be able to reference the system from the proxy using a unique identifier of your choice then add it in addition to the system's serial number.
        - If your storage system has never been added to the Web Service Proxy, utilizing your system's serial number (eseries_system_serial) ensures that the SANtricity collection can discover it and set its initial admin password if not previously done.

    Direct:
        - Provide the storage system's serial number, password and the network subnet (eseries_system_serial, eseries_system_password, and eseries_subnet) to ensure that it will be discoverable; this information will also ensure the admin password has been set. The discovery process can be lengthy depending on the size and speed of the subnet. This can be mitigated by configuring static management interfaces (eseries_management_interfaces) otherwise each playbook execution will search for the DHCP assigned address.
        - If the storage system's Web Service Embedded API url (eseries_system_api_url) is known then it can be used in place of the system's serial number.

Snapshots
---------
    - Automate snapshot consistency groups with one or more base volumes. Consistency groups allow snapshot images to be taken consistently across multiple base volumes at a single point in time. Then use these images to either create snapshot volumes or rollback the base volumes to previous states. Snapshot volumes allow you to interact with the volumes as they were in either a read-only or read-write mode.
    - Since E-Series storage systems are block storage and are unaware of both file system and application, it important to prepare volumes for snapshots. This requires applications to complete anything necessary to place the data in a valid state and file systems to complete and sync data to storage. To help facilitate these actions, checkout the snapshot role in the netapp_eseries.host collection (https://galaxy.ansible.com/netapp_eseries/host). This snapshot role ensures mounted E-Series volumes across multiple hosts have files closed, synced cache, and are temporarily unmounted prior to taking snapshots. Want to take a point-in-time snapshot of a parallel file system? The snapshot role also ensures that volumes are also ready across multiple storage systems.

Remove Inventory Configuration
------------------------------
Whether its for a testing automation or a temporary project, its helpful to be able to undo all that you configured. Just set `eseries_remove_all_configuration: True` and nar_santricity_host will remove all it configured. Be aware that this feature does not know the previous state of anything; it simply removes anything specified in the inventory.

Netapp_Eseries.Santricity Release Notes
=======================================

.. contents:: Topics


v1.1.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

This release focused on providing volume details to through the netapp_volumes_by_initiators in the na_santricity_facts module, improving on the nar_santricity_common role storage system API information and resolving issues.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Add functionality to remove all inventory configuration in the nar_santricity_host role. Set configuration.eseries_remove_all_configuration=True to remove all storage pool/volume configuration, host, hostgroup, and lun mapping configuration.
- Add host_types, host_port_protocols, host_port_information, hostside_io_interface_protocols to netapp_volumes_by_initiators in the na_santricity_facts module.
- Add storage pool information to the volume_by_initiator facts.
- Add storage system not found exception to the common role's build_info task.
- Add volume_metadata option to na_santricity_volume module, add volume_metadata information to the netapp_volumes_by_initiators dictionary in na_santricity_facts module, and update the nar_santricity_host role with the option.
- Improve nar_santricity_common storage system api determinations; attempts to discover the storage system using the information provided in the inventory before attempting to search the subnet.
- Increased the storage system discovery connection timeouts to 30 seconds to prevent systems from not being discovered over slow connections.
- Minimize the facts gathered for the host initiators.
- Update ib iser determination to account for changes in firmware 11.60.2.
- Use existing Web Services Proxy storage system identifier when one is already created and one is not provided in the inventory.
- Utilize eseries_iscsi_iqn before searching host for iqn in nar_santricity_host role.

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix check_port_type method for ib iser when ib is the port type.
- Fix examples in the netapp_e_mgmt_interface module.
- Fix issue with changing host port name.
- Fix na_santricity_lun_mapping unmapping issue; previously mapped volumes failed to be unmapped.
