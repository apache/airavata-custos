BGP role
========

This role facilitates the configuration of border gateway protocol (BGP) attributes. It supports the configuration of router ID, networks, neighbors, and maximum path. This role is abstracted for Dell EMC PowerSwitch platforms running Dell EMC OS6.

The BGP role requires an SSH connection for connectivity to a Dell EMC OS6 device. You can use any of the built-in OS connection variables.


Role variables
--------------
 
- Role is abstracted using the `ansible_network_os` variable that can take `dellemc.os6.os6` as a value
- If variable `os6_cfg_generate` is set to true, it generates the role configuration commands in a file
- Any role variable with a corresponding state variable setting to absent negates the configuration of that variable
- Setting an empty value for any variable negates the corresponding configuration
- Variables and values are case-sensitive

> **NOTE**: IP routing needs to be enabled on the switch prior to configuring BGP via the *os6_bgp* role.

Connection variables
--------------------

Ansible Dell EMC network roles require connection information to establish communication with the nodes in your inventory. This information can exist in the Ansible *group_vars* or *host_vars* directories or inventory, or in the playbook itself.

| Key         | Required | Choices    | Description                                         |
|-------------|----------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ``ansible_host`` | yes      |            | Specifies the hostname or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport |
| ``ansible_port`` | no       |            | Specifies the port used to build the connection to the remote device; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_REMOTE_PORT` option is used; it defaults to 22 |
| ``ansible_ssh_user`` | no       |            | Specifies the username that authenticates the CLI login for the connection to the remote device; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_REMOTE_USER` environment variable value is used  |
| ``ansible_ssh_pass`` | no       |            | Specifies the password that authenticates the connection to the remote device.  |
| ``ansible_become`` | no       | yes, no\*   | Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_BECOME` environment variable value is used, and the device attempts to execute all commands in non-privileged mode |
| ``ansible_become_method`` | no       | enable, sudo\*   | Instructs the module to allow the become method to be specified for handling privilege escalation; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_BECOME_METHOD` environment variable value is used. |
| ``ansible_become_pass`` | no       |            | Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device; if ``ansible_become`` is set to no this key is not applicable. |
| ``ansible_network_os`` | yes      | os6, null\*  | This value is used to load the correct terminal and cliconf plugins to communicate with the remote device. |

> **NOTE**: Asterisk (\*) denotes the default value if none is specified.

Example playbook
----------------

This example uses the *os6_bgp* role to configure the BGP network and neighbors. It creates a *hosts* file with the switch details, a *host_vars* file with connection variables and the corresponding role variables.

When `os6_cfg_generate` is set to true, the variable generates the configuration commands as a .part file in *build_dir* path. By default, the variable is set to false. This example writes a simple playbook that only references the *os6_bgp* role. 

**Sample hosts file**

    switch1 ansible_host= <ip_address>
