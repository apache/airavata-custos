VLAN role
=========

This role facilitates configuring virtual LAN (VLAN) attributes. It supports the creation and deletion of a VLAN and its member ports. This role is abstracted for Dell EMC PowerSwitch platforms running Dell EMC OS6. 

The VLAN role requires an SSH connection for connectivity to a Dell EMC OS6 device. You can use any of the built-in OS connection variables.


Role variables
--------------

- Role is abstracted using the `ansible_network_os` variable that can take `dellemc.os6.os6` as a value 
- If `os6_cfg_generate` is set to true, the variable generates the role configuration commands in a file
- Any role variable with a corresponding state variable set to absent negates the configuration of that variable
- For variables with no state variable, setting an empty value for the variable negates the corresponding configuration
- `os6_vlan` (dictionary) holds the key with the VLAN ID key and default-vlan key.
- VLAN ID key should be in format "vlan <ID>" (1 to 4094)
- Variables and values are case-sensitive


**VLAN ID keys**

| Key        | Type                      | Notes                                                   | Support               |
|------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| ``tagged_members_append`` | boolean: true,false         | appends the tagged vlan members to the existing list on the interfaces | os6 |
| ``tagged_members_state``  | string: absent,present      | removes all tagged members | os6 |
| ``vlan <id>`` | string | specifiy the vlan to be configured (see ``vlan <id>.*``) | os6 |
| ``vlan <id>.name``             | string                        | Configures the name of the VLAN, field needs to be left blank to remove the user defined name and assign the default name                    | os6 |
| ``vlan <id>.tagged_members``   | list         | Specifies the list of port members to be tagged to the corresponding VLAN (see ``tagged_members.*``) | os6 |
| ``tagged_members.port`` | string | Specifies valid device interface names to be tagged for each VLAN | os6 |
| ``tagged_members.state`` | string: absent,present | Deletes the tagged association for the VLAN if set to absent | os6 |
| ``vlan <id>.untagged_members`` | list         | Specifies the list of port members to be untagged to the corresponding VLAN (see ``untagged_members.*``) | os6 |
| ``untagged_members.port`` | string | Specifies valid device interface names to be untagged for each VLAN | os6 |
| ``untagged_members.state`` | string: absent,present | Deletes the untagged association for the VLAN if set to absent | os6 |
| ``vlan <id>.state``           | string: absent,present\*          | Deletes the VLAN corresponding to the ID if set to absent | os6 |

                                                                                                      
> **NOTE**: Asterisk (\*) denotes the default value if none is specified.

Connection variables
--------------------

Ansible Dell EMC Networking roles require connection information to establish communication with the nodes in your inventory. This information can exist in the Ansible *group_vars* or *host_vars directories* or inventory, or in the playbook itself.

| Key         | Required | Choices    | Description                                         |
|-------------|----------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ``ansible_host`` | yes      |            | Specifies the hostname or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport |
| ``ansible_port`` | no       |            | Specifies the port used to build the connection to the remote device; if value is unspecified, the ANSIBLE_REMOTE_PORT option is used; it defaults to 22 |
| ``ansible_ssh_user`` | no       |            | Specifies the username that authenticates the CLI login for the connection to the remote device; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_REMOTE_USER` environment variable value is used  |
| ``ansible_ssh_pass`` | no       |            | Specifies the password that authenticates the connection to the remote device.  |
| ``ansible_become`` | no       | yes, no\*   | Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_BECOME` environment variable value is used, and the device attempts to execute all commands in non-privileged mode |
| ``ansible_become_method`` | no       | enable, sudo\*   | Instructs the module to allow the become method to be specified for handling privilege escalation; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_BECOME_METHOD` environment variable value is used |
| ``ansible_become_pass`` | no       |            | Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device; if ``ansible_become`` is set to no this key is not applicable |
| ``ansible_network_os`` | yes      | os6, null\*  | Loads the correct terminal and cliconf plugins to communicate with the remote device |


> **NOTE**: Asterisk (\*) denotes the default value if none is specified.

## Example playbook

This example uses the *os6_vlan* role to setup the VLAN ID and name, and it configures tagged and untagged port members for the VLAN. You can also delete the VLAN with the ID or delete the members associated to it. It creates a *hosts* file with the switch details and corresponding variables. The hosts file should define the `ansible_network_os` variable with corresponding Dell EMC OS6 name. 

When `os6_cfg_generate` is set to true, the variable generates the configuration commands as a .part file in *build_dir* path. By default, the variable is set to false. It writes a simple playbook that only references the os6_vlan role.

**Sample hosts file**

    switch1 ansible_host= <ip_address>

**Sample host_vars/switch1**
     
    hostname: switch1
    ansible_become: yes
    ansible_become_method: enable
    ansible_become_pass: xxxxx
    ansible_ssh_user: xxxxx
    ansible_ssh_pass: xxxxx
    ansible_network_os: dellemc.os6.os6
    build_dir: ../temp/temp_os6

    os6_vlan:
        tagged_members_append: False
        tagged_members_state: present
        vlan 100:
          name: "Mgmt Network"
          tagged_members:
            - port: Te1/0/30
              state: absent
          untagged_members:
            - port: Fo1/0/14
              state: present
          state: present


**Simple playbook to setup system â€” switch1.yaml**

    - hosts: switch1
      roles:
         - dellemc.os6.os6_vlan
                
**Run**

    ansible-playbook -i hosts switch1.yaml
