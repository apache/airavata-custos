Prefix-list role
================

This role facilitates the configuration of a prefix-list. It supports the configuration of an IP prefix-list, and assigns the prefix-list to line terminals. This role is abstracted for Dell EMC PowerSwitch platforms running Dell EMC OS9.

The prefix-list role requires an SSH connection for connectivity to a Dell EMC OS9 device. You can use any of the built-in OS connection variables.

Role variables
--------------

- Role is abstracted using the `ansible_network_os` variable that can take `dellemc.os9.os9` as the value
- If `os9_cfg_generate` set to true, the variable generates the role configuration commands in a file
- Any role variable with a corresponding state variable set to absent negates the configuration of that variable
- Setting an empty value for any variable negates the corresponding configuration
- Variables and values are case-sensitive

Connection variables
--------------------

Ansible Dell EMC network roles require connection information to establish communication with the nodes in your inventory. This information can exist in the Ansible *group_vars* or *host_vars* directories, or inventory or in the playbook itself.

| Key         | Required | Choices    | Description                                         |
|-------------|----------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ``ansible_host`` | yes      |            | Specifies the hostname or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport |
| ``ansible_port`` | no       |            | Specifies the port used to build the connection to the remote device; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_REMOTE_PORT` option is used; it defaults to 22 |
| ``ansible_ssh_user`` | no       |            | Specifies the username that authenticates the CLI login for the connection to the remote device; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_REMOTE_USER` environment variable value is used  |
| ``ansible_ssh_pass`` | no       |            | Specifies the password that authenticates the connection to the remote device |
| ``ansible_become`` | no       | yes, no\*   | Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_BECOME` environment variable value is used, and the device attempts to execute all commands in non-privileged mode |
| ``ansible_become_method`` | no       | enable, sudo\*   | Instructs the module to allow the become method to be specified for handling privilege escalation; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_BECOME_METHOD` environment variable value is used |
| ``ansible_become_pass`` | no       |            | Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device; if ``ansible_become`` is set to no this key is not applicable |
| ``ansible_network_os`` | yes      | os9, null\*  | Loads the correct terminal and cliconf plugins to communicate with the remote device |

> **NOTE**: Asterisk (\*) denotes the default value if none is specified.

Example playbook
----------------

This example uses the *os9_prefix_list* role to configure prefix_list for both IPv4 and IPv6. It creates a *hosts* file with the switch details and corresponding variables. The hosts file should define the `ansible_network_os` variable with corresponding Dell EMC OS9 name. 

When `os9_cfg_generate` is set to true, the variable generates the configuration commands as a .part file in *build_dir* path. By default, the variable is set to false. It writes a simple playbook that only references the *os9_prefix_list* role. 

**Sample hosts file**
 
    leaf1 ansible_host= <ip_address> 

**Sample host_vars/leaf1**

    hostname: leaf1
    ansible_become: yes
    ansible_become_method: xxxxx
    ansible_become_pass: xxxxx
    ansible_ssh_user: xxxxx
    ansible_ssh_pass: xxxxx
    ansible_network_os: dellemc.os9.os9
    build_dir: ../temp/os9
    os9_prefix_list:
      - type: ipv4
        name: spine-leaf
        description: Redistribute loopback and leaf networks 
        entries:
          - number: 5
            permit: true
            net_num: 10.0.0.0
            mask: 23
            condition_list:
              - condition: ge
                prelen: 32
          - number: 19
            permit: true
            net_num: 20.0.0.0
            mask: 16
            condition_list:
              - condition: ge
                prelen: 17
              - condition: le
                prelen: 18
            state: present
         state: present

**Simple playbook to setup system â€” leaf.yaml**

    - hosts: leaf1
      roles:
         - dellemc.os9.os9_prefix_list

**Run**

    ansible-playbook -i hosts leaf.yaml
