Copy-config role
================

This role is used to push the backup running configuration into a Dell EMC OS9 device, and merges the configuration in the template file with the running configuration of the device. This role is abstracted for Dell EMC PowerSwitch platforms running Dell EMC OS9.

The copy-config role requires an SSH connection for connectivity to a Dell EMC OS9 device. You can use any of the built-in OS connection variables.


Role variables
--------------

- No predefined variables are part of this role
- Use *host_vars* or *group_vars* as part of the template file
- Configuration file is host-specific
- Copy the host-specific configuration to the respective file under the template directory in *<host_name>.j2* format
- Variables and values are case-sensitive

Connection variables
--------------------

Ansible Dell EMC network roles require connection information to establish communication with the nodes in your inventory. This information can exist in the Ansible *group_vars* or *host_vars* directories, or in the playbook itself.

| Key         | Required | Choices    | Description                                         |
|-------------|----------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ``ansible_host`` | yes      |            | Specifies the hostname or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport |
| ``ansible_port`` | no       |            | Specifies the port used to build the connection to the remote device; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_REMOTE_PORT` option is used; it defaults to 22 |
| ``ansible_ssh_user`` | no       |            | Specifies the username that authenticates the CLI login for the connection to the remote device; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_REMOTE_USER` environment variable value is used  |
| ``ansible_ssh_pass`` | no       |            | Specifies the password that authenticates the connection to the remote device.  |
| ``ansible_become`` | no       | yes, no\*   | Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_BECOME` environment variable value is used, and the device attempts to execute all commands in non-privileged mode |
| ``ansible_become_method`` | no       | enable, sudo\*   | Instructs the module to allow the become method to be specified for handling privilege escalation; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_BECOME_METHOD` environment variable value is used |
| ``ansible_become_pass`` | no       |            | Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device; if ``ansible_become`` is set to no this key is not applicable |
| ``ansible_network_os`` | yes      | os9, null\*  | Loads the correct terminal and cliconf plugins to communicate with the remote device |

> **NOTE**: Asterisk (\*) denotes the default value if none is specified.

Example playbook
----------------

This example uses the *os9_copy_config* role to push the configuration file into the device. It creates a *hosts* file with the switch details and corresponding variables. It writes a simple playbook that only references the *os9_copy_config* role. By including the role, you automatically get access to all of the tasks to push configuration file.

**Sample hosts file**

    leaf1 ansible_host= <ip_address> 

**Sample host_vars/leaf1**

    hostname: leaf1
    ansible_become: yes
    ansible_become_method: xxxxx
    ansible_become_pass: xxxxx
    ansible_ssh_user: xxxxx
    ansible_ssh_pass: xxxxx
    ansible_network_os: dellemc.os9.os9

    # This variable shall be applied in the below jinja template for each host by defining here
    os9_bgp
       asn: 64801

**Simple playbook to setup to push configuration file into device â€” leaf.yaml**

    - hosts: leaf1
      roles:
         - dellemc.os9.os9_copy_config

**Run**

    ansible-playbook -i hosts leaf.yaml
