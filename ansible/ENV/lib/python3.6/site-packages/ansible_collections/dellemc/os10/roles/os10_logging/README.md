Logging role
============

This role facilitates the configuration of global logging attributes, and it supports the configuration of logging servers. This role is abstracted for Dell EMC PowerSwitch platforms running Dell EMC SmartFabric OS10.

The Logging role requires an SSH connection for connectivity to a Dell EMC SmartFabric OS10 device. You can use any of the built-in OS connection variables.

Role variables
--------------

- Role is abstracted using the `ansible_network_os` variable that can take `dellemc.os10.os10` as the value
- If `os10_cfg_generate` is set to true, it generates the role configuration commands in a file
- Any role variable with a corresponding state variable set to absent negates the configuration of that variable
- Setting an empty value for any variable negates the corresponding configuration
- Variables and values are case-sensitive

**os10_logging keys**

| Key        | Type                      | Description                                             | Support               |
|------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|

| ``log_file.severity`` | string | Configures the minimum severity level for logging to a log file | os10 |
| ``source_interface`` | string | Configures the source interface for logging | os10 |

> **NOTE**: Asterisk (_*_) denotes the default value if none is specified. 

Connection variables
--------------------

Ansible Dell EMC network roles require connection information to establish communication with the nodes in your inventory. This information can exist in the Ansible *group_vars* or *host_vars* directories or inventory, or in the playbook itself.

| Key         | Required | Choices    | Description                                         |
|-------------|----------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ``ansible_host`` | yes      |            | Specifies the hostname or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport |
| ``ansible_port`` | no       |            | Specifies the port used to build the connection to the remote device; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_REMOTE_PORT` option is used; it defaults to 22 |
| ``ansible_ssh_user`` | no       |            | Specifies the username that authenticates the CLI login for the connection to the remote device; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_REMOTE_USER` environment variable value is used  |
| ``ansible_ssh_pass`` | no       |            | Specifies the password that authenticates the connection to the remote device  |
| ``ansible_become`` | no       | yes, no\*   | Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_BECOME` environment variable value is used, and the device attempts to execute all commands in non-privileged mode |
| ``ansible_become_method`` | no       | enable, sudo\*   | Instructs the module to allow the become method to be specified for handling privilege escalation; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_BECOME_METHOD` environment variable value is used |
| ``ansible_become_pass`` | no       |            | Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device; if ``ansible_become`` is set to no this key is not applicable |
| ``ansible_network_os`` | yes      | os10, null\*  | Loads the correct terminal and cliconf plugins to communicate with the remote device |

> **NOTE**: Asterisk (\*) denotes the default value if none is specified.


Example playbook
----------------

This example uses the *os10_logging* role to completely set up logging servers. It creates a *hosts* file with the switch details and corresponding variables. The hosts file should define the `ansible_network_os` variable with corresponding Dell EMC OS10 name. 

When `os10_cfg_generate` is set to true, the variable generates the configuration commands as a .part file in *build_dir* path. By default, the variable is set to false.

**Sample hosts file**
 
    leaf1 ansible_host= <ip_address> 

**Sample host_vars/leaf1**

    hostname: leaf1
    ansible_become: yes
    ansible_become_method: xxxxx
    ansible_become_pass: xxxxx
    ansible_ssh_user: xxxxx
    ansible_ssh_pass: xxxxx
    ansible_network_os: dellemc.os10.os10
    build_dir: ../temp/temp_os10
	  
    os10_logging:
        logging:
          - ip: 1.1.1.1
            state: absent
        console:
          enable: True
          severity: log-err
        log_file:
          enable: True
          severity: log-err
        source_interface: "ethernet1/1/30"

**Simple playbook to setup logging â€” leaf.yaml**

    - hosts: leaf1
      roles:
         - dellemc.os10.os10_logging

**Run**

    ansible-playbook -i hosts leaf.yaml
