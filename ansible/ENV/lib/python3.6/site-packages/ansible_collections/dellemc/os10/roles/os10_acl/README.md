ACL role
========

This role facilitates the configuration of an access-control list (ACL). It supports the configuration of different types of ACLs (standard and extended) for both IPv4 and IPv6, and assigns the access-class to the line terminals. This role is abstracted for Dell EMC PowerSwitch platforms running Dell EMC SmartFabric OS10.

The ACL role requires an SSH connection for connectivity to a Dell EMC SmartFabric OS10 device. You can use any of the built-in OS connection variables.

Role variables
--------------

- Role is abstracted using the `ansible_network_os` variable that can take `dellemc.os10.os10` as the value
- If `os10_cfg_generate` is set to true, the variable generates the role configuration commands in a file
- Any role variable with a corresponding state variable set to absent negates the configuration of that variable
- Setting an empty value for any variable negates the corresponding configuration
- Variables and values are case-sensitive

Connection variables
--------------------

Ansible Dell EMC network roles require connection information to establish communication with the nodes in inventory. This information can exist in the Ansible *group_vars* or *host_vars* directories or inventory, or in the playbook itself.

| Key         | Required | Choices    | Description                                           |
|-------------|----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| ``ansible_host`` | yes      |            | Specifies the hostname or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport |
| ``ansible_port`` | no       |            | Specifies the port used to build the connection to the remote device; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_REMOTE_PORT` option is used; it defaults to 22 |
| ``ansible_ssh_user`` | no       |            | Specifies the username that authenticates the CLI login for the connection to the remote device; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_REMOTE_USER` environment variable value is used  |
| ``ansible_ssh_pass`` | no       |            | Specifies the password that authenticates the connection to the remote device |
| ``ansible_become`` | no       | yes, no\*   | Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_BECOM`E environment variable value is used, and the device attempts to execute all commands in non-privileged mode |
| ``ansible_become_method`` | no       | enable, sudo\*   | Instructs the module to allow the become method to be specified for handling privilege escalation; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_BECOME_METHOD` environment variable value is used |
| ``ansible_become_pass`` | no       |            | Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device; if ``ansible_become`` is set to no this key is not applicable |
| ``ansible_network_os`` | yes      | os10, null\*  | Loads the correct terminal and cliconf plugins to communicate with the remote device |

> **NOTE**: Asterisk (_*_) denotes the default value if none is specified.


Example playbook
----------------

This example uses the *os10_acl* role to configure different types of ACLs (standard and extended) for both IPv4 and IPv6 and assigns the access-class to the line terminals. The example creates a *hosts* file with the switch details and corresponding variables. The hosts file should define the `ansible_network_os` variable with the corresponding Dell EMC OS10 name. 

When `os10_cfg_generate` is set to true, it generates the configuration commands as a .part file in the *build_dir* path. By default it is set to false. It writes a simple playbook that only references the *os10_acl* role. 

**Sample hosts file**

    leaf1 ansible_host= <ip_address> 

**Sample host_vars/leaf1**

    hostname: leaf1
    ansible_become: yes
    ansible_become_method: xxxxx
    ansible_become_pass: xxxxx
    ansible_ssh_user: xxxxx
    ansible_ssh_pass: xxxxx
    ansible_network_os: dellemc.os10.os10
    build_dir: ../temp/temp_os10
    os10_acl:
       - name: ssh
         type: ipv4
         description: acl
         remark:
           - description: 1

             state: absent
         entries:
           - number: 14
             permit: true

             src_condition: neq 6
             destination: any
             dest_condition: eq 4
             other_options: count
             state: present
         stage_ingress:
              - name: ethernet 1/1/1
                state: absent
              - name: ethernet 1/1/2
                state: absent
         stage_egress:
              - name: ethernet 1/1/3
                state: absent
         lineterminal:
              state: absent
         state: present
            
**Simple playbook to setup system â€” leaf.yaml**
