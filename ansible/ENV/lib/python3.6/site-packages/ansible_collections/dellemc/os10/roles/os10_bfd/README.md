BFD role
===========

This role facilitates the configuration of bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) global attributes. It specifically enables configuration of BFD interval, min_rx, multiplier, and role. This role is abstracted for Dell EMC PowerSwitch platforms running Dell EMC SmartFabric OS10.

The BFD role requires an SSH connection for connectivity to a Dell EMC SmartFabric OS10 device. You can use any of the built-in OS connection variables.

Role variables
--------------

- Role is abstracted using the `ansible_network_os` variable that can take `dellemc.os10.os10` as the value
- If `os10_cfg_generate` is set to true, the variable generates the role configuration commands in a file
- Any role variable with a corresponding state variable set to absent negates the configuration of that variable
- Setting an empty value for any variable negates the corresponding configuration
- Variables and values are case-sensitive

**os10_bfd keys**

| Key        | Type                      | Description                                             | Support               |
|------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| ``bfd`` | dictionary | Configures global BFD parameters (see ``bfd.*``) | os10 |
| ``bfd.interval`` | integer | Configures the time interval in ms (100 to 1000) | os10 |
| ``bfd.min_rx`` | integer | Configures maximum waiting time for receiving control packets from BFD peers in ms (100 to 1000)| os10 |
| ``bfd.multiplier`` | integer | Configures the maximum number of consecutive packets that are not received from BFD peers before session state changes to Down (3 to 50) | os10 |
| ``bfd.role`` | string: passive,active\* | Configures the BFD role | os10 |
| ``bfd.state`` | string: absent,present\* | Removes the global BFD if set to absent | os10 |

> **NOTE**: Asterisk (\*) denotes the default value if none is specified. 

Connection variables
********************

Ansible Dell EMC network roles require connection information to establish communication with the nodes in your inventory. This information can exist in the Ansible *group_vars* or *host_vars* directories, or inventory or in the playbook itself.

| Key         | Required | Choices    | Description                                         |
|-------------|----------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ``ansible_host`` | yes      |            | Specifies the hostname or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport |
| ``ansible_port`` | no       |            | Specifies the port used to build the connection to the remote device; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_REMOTE_PORT` option is used; it defaults to 22 |
| ``ansible_ssh_user`` | no       |            | Specifies the username that authenticates the CLI login for the connection to the remote device; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_REMOTE_USER` environment variable value is used  |
| ``ansible_ssh_pass`` | no       |            | Specifies the password that authenticates the connection to the remote device |
| ``ansible_become`` | no       | yes, no\*   | Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_BECOME` environment variable value is used, and the device attempts to execute all commands in non-privileged mode |
| ``ansible_become_method`` | no       | enable, sudo\*   | Instructs the module to allow the become method to be specified for handling privilege escalation; if value is unspecified, the `ANSIBLE_BECOME_METHOD` environment variable value is used |
| ``ansible_become_pass`` | no       |            | Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device; if ``ansible_become`` is set to no this key is not applicable |
| ``ansible_network_os`` | yes      | os10, null\*  | Loads the correct terminal and cliconf plugins to communicate with the remote device |

> **NOTE**: Asterisk (\*) denotes the default value if none is specified.


Example playbook
----------------

This example uses the *os10_bfd role* to completely set the global BFD attributes. It creates a *hosts* file with the switch details and corresponding variables. The hosts file should define the `ansible_network_os` variable with corresponding Dell EMC OS10 name. 

When `os10_cfg_generate` is set to true, the variable generates the configuration commands as a .part file in *build_dir* path. By default, the variable is set to false. The bfd role writes a simple playbook that only references the *os10_bfd* role. By including the role, you automatically get access to all of the tasks to configure BFD feature. 

**Sample hosts file**
 
    leaf1 ansible_host= <ip_address> 

**Sample host_vars/leaf1**

    hostname: leaf1
    ansible_become: yes
    ansible_become_method: xxxxx
    ansible_become_pass: xxxxx
    ansible_ssh_user: xxxxx
    ansible_ssh_pass: xxxxx
    ansible_network_os: dellemc.os10.os10
    build_dir: ../temp/os10
	  
    os10_bfd:
      bfd:
        interval: 100
        min_rx: 100
        multiplier: 3
        role: "active"
        state: "present"

**Simple playbook to setup bfd â€” leaf.yaml**

    - hosts: leaf1
      roles:
         - dellemc.os10.os10_bfd

**Run**

    ansible-playbook -i hosts leaf.yaml
