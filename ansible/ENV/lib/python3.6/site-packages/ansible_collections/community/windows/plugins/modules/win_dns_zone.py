module: win_dns_zone
short_description: Manage Windows Server DNS Zones
author: Joe Zollo (@joezollo)
requirements:
  - This module requires Windows Server 2012R2 or Newer
description:
  - Manage Windows Server DNS Zones
  - Adds, Removes and Modifies DNS Zones - Primary, Secondary, Forwarder & Stub
  - Task should be delegated to a Windows DNS Server
options:
  name:
    description:
      - Fully qualified name of the DNS zone.
    type: str
    required: true
  type:
    description:
      - Specifies the type of DNS zone.
      - When l(type=secondary), the DNS server will immediately attempt to
        perform a zone transfer from the servers in this list. If this initial
        transfer fails, then the zone will be left in an unworkable state.
        This module does not verify the initial transfer.
    type: str
    choices: [ primary, secondary, stub, forwarder ]
  dynamic_update:
    description:
      - Specifies how a zone handles dynamic updates.
      - Secure DNS updates are available only for Active Directory-integrated
        zones.
      - When not specified during new zone creation, Windows will default this
        to l(none).
    type: str
    choices: [ secure, none, nonsecureandsecure ]
  state:
    description:
      - Specifies the desired state of the DNS zone.
      - When l(state=present) the module will attempt to create the specified
        DNS zone if it does not already exist.
      - When l(state=absent), the module will remove the specified DNS
        zone and all subsequent DNS records.
    type: str
    default: present
    choices: [ present, absent ]
  forwarder_timeout:
    description:
      - Specifies a length of time, in seconds, that a DNS server waits for a
        remote DNS server to resolve a query.
      - Accepts integer values between 0 and 15.
      - If the provided value is not valid, it will be omitted and a warning
        will be issued.
    type: int
  replication:
    description:
      - Specifies the replication scope for the DNS zone.
      - l(replication=forest) will replicate the DNS zone to all domain
        controllers in the Active Directory forest.
      - l(replication=domain) will replicate the DNS zone to all domain
        controllers in the Active Directory domain.
      - l(replication=none) disables Active Directory integration and
        creates a local file with the name of the zone.
      - This is the equivalent of selecting l(store the zone in Active
        Directory) in the GUI.
    type: str
    choices: [ forest, domain, legacy, none ]
  dns_servers:
    description:
      - Specifies an list of IP addresses of the primary servers of the zone.
      - DNS queries for a forwarded zone are sent to primary servers.
      - Required if l(type=secondary), l(type=forwarder) or l(type=stub),
        otherwise ignored.
      - At least one server is required.
    elements: str
    type: list
