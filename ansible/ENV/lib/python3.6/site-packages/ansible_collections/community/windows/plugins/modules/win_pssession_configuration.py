  async_poll:
    description:
      - Sets a delay in seconds between each check of the asynchronous execution status.
      - Replicates the functionality of the C(poll) keyword.
      - Has no effect in check mode.
    type: int
    default: 1
notes:
  - This module will restart the WinRM service on any change. This will terminate all WinRM connections including those by other Ansible runs.
  - Internally this module uses C(async) when not in check mode to ensure things goes smoothly when restarting the WinRM service.
  - The standard C(async) and C(poll) keywords cannot be used; instead use the I(async_timeout) and I(async_poll) options to control asynchronous execution.
  - Setting I(async_poll=0) will return a result that can be used with C(async_status).
  - Options that don't list a default value here will use the defaults of C(New-PSSessionConfigurationFile) and C(Register-PSSessionConfiguration).
  - If a value can be specified in both a session config file and directly in the session options, this module will prefer the setting be in the config file.
