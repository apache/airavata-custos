# removing a user doesn't remove their profile (which includes the filesystem directory and registry key).
# without cleaning up, every CI run will create a new path and key and they will build up over time.
# this finds all profiles on the system, via the registry, whose path basename starts with one of our test users
# and then deletes the directory; if that was succesful, it deletes the registry key too.
#
# As a result this should also clean up after any old runs that left behind profiles, so an interrupted run
# that didn't run the rescue block will still get cleaned up by the next when this runs again.
