  1.0.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - docker_container - the validation for ``capabilities`` in ``device_requests``
        was incorrect (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/42,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/43).

  1.1.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - docker_image - if ``push=true`` is used with ``repository``, and the image
        does not need to be tagged, still push. This can happen if ``repository``
        and ``name`` are equal (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/52,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/53).
      - docker_image - report error when loading a broken archive that contains no
        image (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/46,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/55).
      - docker_image - report error when the loaded archive does not contain the specified
        image (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/41,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/55).
      deprecated_features:
      - docker_container - currently ``published_ports`` can contain port mappings
        next to the special value ``all``, in which case the port mappings are ignored.
        This behavior is deprecated for community.docker 2.0.0, at which point it
        will either be forbidden, or this behavior will be properly implemented similar
        to how the Docker CLI tool handles this (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/8,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/60).
      minor_changes:
      - docker_container - support specifying ``cgroup_parent`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/6,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/59).
      - docker_container - when a container is started with ``detached=false``, ``status``
        is now also returned when it is 0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/26,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/58).
      - docker_image - support ``platform`` when building images (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/22,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/54).

  1.2.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - docker_container - allow IPv6 zones (RFC 4007) in bind IPs (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/66).
      - docker_image - fix crash on loading images with versions of Docker SDK for
        Python before 2.5.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/72,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/73).
      minor_changes:
      - docker_container - added ``default_host_ip`` option which allows to explicitly
        set the default IP string for published ports without explicitly specified
        IPs. When using IPv6 binds with Docker 20.10.2 or newer, this needs to be
        set to an empty string (``""``) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/70,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/71).

  1.2.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - docker connection plugin - fix Docker version parsing, as some docker versions
        have a leading ``v`` in the output of the command ``docker version --format
        "{{.Server.Version}}"`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/76).

    changes:
      release_summary: Security bugfix release to address CVE-2021-20191.
      security_fixes:

    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - docker_container - fix healthcheck disabling idempotency issue with strict
        comparison (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/85).
      - docker_image - prevent module failure when removing image that is removed
        between inspection and removal (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/87).
      - docker_image - prevent module failure when removing non-existant image by
        ID (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/87).
      - docker_image_info - prevent module failure when image vanishes between listing
        and inspection (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/87).
      - docker_image_info - prevent module failure when querying non-existant image
        by ID (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/87).
      minor_changes:
      - docker_container - add ``storage_opts`` option to specify storage options
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/91, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/93).
      - docker_image - allows to specify platform to pull for ``source=pull`` with
        new option ``pull_platform`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/79,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/89).
      - docker_image - properly support image IDs (hashes) for loading and tagging
        images (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/86,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/87).
      - docker_swarm_service - adding support for maximum number of tasks per node
        (``replicas_max_per_node``) when running swarm service in replicated mode.
        Introduced in API 1.40 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/7,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/92).

  1.4.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - docker_swarm - if ``join_token`` is specified, a returned join token with
        the same value will be replaced by ``VALUE_SPECIFIED_IN_NO_LOG_PARAMETER``.
        Make sure that you do not blindly use the join tokens from the return value
        of this module when the module is invoked with ``join_token`` specified! This
        breaking change appears in a minor release since it is necessary to fix a
        security issue (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/103).
      bugfixes:
      - '``docker_swarm_service`` - fix KeyError on caused by reference to deprecated
        option ``update_failure_action`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/100).'
      - docker_swarm_service - mark ``secrets`` module option with ``no_log=False``
        since it does not leak secrets (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/2001).
      minor_changes:
      - docker_swarm_service - change ``publish.published_port`` option from mandatory
        to optional. Docker will assign random high port if not specified (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/99).
      release_summary: Security release to address another potential secret leak.
        Also includes regular bugfixes and features.
      security_fixes:
      - docker_swarm - the ``join_token`` option is now marked as ``no_log`` so it
        is no longer written into logs (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/103).

  1.5.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - all modules - use ``to_native`` to convert exceptions to strings (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/121).
      minor_changes:
      - Add the ``use_ssh_client`` option to most docker modules and plugins (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/108,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/114).

  1.6.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - 'docker-compose - fix not pulling when ``state: present`` and ``stopped: true``
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/12, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/119).'
      - docker_plugin - also configure plugin after installing (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/118,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/135).
      - docker_swarm_services - avoid crash during idempotence check if ``published_port``
        is not specified (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/107,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/136).
      deprecated_features:
      - docker_* modules and plugins, except ``docker_swarm`` connection plugin and
        ``docker_compose`` and ``docker_stack*` modules - the current default ``localhost``
        for ``tls_hostname`` is deprecated. In community.docker 2.0.0 it will be computed
        from ``docker_host`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/134).
      minor_changes:
      - common module utils - correct error messages for guiding to install proper
        Docker SDK for Python module (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/125).
      - 'docker_container - allow ``memory_swap: -1`` to set memory swap limit to
        unlimited. This is useful when the user cannot set memory swap limits due
        to cgroup limitations or other reasons, as by default Docker will try to set
        swap usage to two times the value of ``memory`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/138).'
