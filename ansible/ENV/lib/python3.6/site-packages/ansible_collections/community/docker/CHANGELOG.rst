Docker Community Collection Release Notes
=========================================

.. contents:: Topics


v1.6.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Regular bugfix and feature release.

Minor Changes
-------------

- common module utils - correct error messages for guiding to install proper Docker SDK for Python module (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/125).
- docker_container - allow ``memory_swap: -1`` to set memory swap limit to unlimited. This is useful when the user cannot set memory swap limits due to cgroup limitations or other reasons, as by default Docker will try to set swap usage to two times the value of ``memory`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/138).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- docker_* modules and plugins, except ``docker_swarm`` connection plugin and ``docker_compose`` and ``docker_stack*` modules - the current default ``localhost`` for ``tls_hostname`` is deprecated. In community.docker 2.0.0 it will be computed from ``docker_host`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/134).

Bugfixes
--------

- docker-compose - fix not pulling when ``state: present`` and ``stopped: true`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/12, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/119).
- docker_plugin - also configure plugin after installing (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/118, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/135).
- docker_swarm_services - avoid crash during idempotence check if ``published_port`` is not specified (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/107, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/136).

v1.5.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Regular feature release.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Add the ``use_ssh_client`` option to most docker modules and plugins (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/108, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/114).

Bugfixes
--------

- all modules - use ``to_native`` to convert exceptions to strings (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/121).

New Modules
-----------

- docker_container_exec - Execute command in a docker container

v1.4.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Security release to address another potential secret leak. Also includes regular bugfixes and features.

Minor Changes
-------------

- docker_swarm_service - change ``publish.published_port`` option from mandatory to optional. Docker will assign random high port if not specified (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/99).

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- docker_swarm - if ``join_token`` is specified, a returned join token with the same value will be replaced by ``VALUE_SPECIFIED_IN_NO_LOG_PARAMETER``. Make sure that you do not blindly use the join tokens from the return value of this module when the module is invoked with ``join_token`` specified! This breaking change appears in a minor release since it is necessary to fix a security issue (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/103).

Security Fixes
--------------

- docker_swarm - the ``join_token`` option is now marked as ``no_log`` so it is no longer written into logs (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/103).

Bugfixes
--------

- ``docker_swarm_service`` - fix KeyError on caused by reference to deprecated option ``update_failure_action`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/100).
- docker_swarm_service - mark ``secrets`` module option with ``no_log=False`` since it does not leak secrets (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/2001).

v1.3.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Regular feature and bugfix release.

Minor Changes
-------------

- docker_container - add ``storage_opts`` option to specify storage options (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/91, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/93).
- docker_image - allows to specify platform to pull for ``source=pull`` with new option ``pull_platform`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/79, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/89).
- docker_image - properly support image IDs (hashes) for loading and tagging images (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/86, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/87).
- docker_swarm_service - adding support for maximum number of tasks per node (``replicas_max_per_node``) when running swarm service in replicated mode. Introduced in API 1.40 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/7, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/92).

Bugfixes
--------

- docker_container - fix healthcheck disabling idempotency issue with strict comparison (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/85).
- docker_image - prevent module failure when removing image that is removed between inspection and removal (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/87).
- docker_image - prevent module failure when removing non-existant image by ID (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/87).
- docker_image_info - prevent module failure when image vanishes between listing and inspection (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/87).
- docker_image_info - prevent module failure when querying non-existant image by ID (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/87).

New Modules
-----------

- docker_image_load - Load docker image(s) from archives
- docker_plugin - Manage Docker plugins

v1.2.2
======

Release Summary
---------------

Security bugfix release to address CVE-2021-20191.

Security Fixes
--------------

- docker_swarm - enabled ``no_log`` for the option ``signing_ca_key`` to prevent accidental disclosure (CVE-2021-20191, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/80).

v1.2.1
======

Release Summary
---------------

Bugfix release.

Bugfixes
--------

- docker connection plugin - fix Docker version parsing, as some docker versions have a leading ``v`` in the output of the command ``docker version --format "{{.Server.Version}}"`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/76).

v1.2.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Feature release with one new feature and two bugfixes.

Minor Changes
-------------

- docker_container - added ``default_host_ip`` option which allows to explicitly set the default IP string for published ports without explicitly specified IPs. When using IPv6 binds with Docker 20.10.2 or newer, this needs to be set to an empty string (``""``) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/70, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/71).

Bugfixes
--------

- docker_container - allow IPv6 zones (RFC 4007) in bind IPs (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/66).
- docker_image - fix crash on loading images with versions of Docker SDK for Python before 2.5.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/72, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/73).

v1.1.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Feature release with three new plugins and modules.

Minor Changes
-------------

- docker_container - support specifying ``cgroup_parent`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/6, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/59).
- docker_container - when a container is started with ``detached=false``, ``status`` is now also returned when it is 0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/26, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/58).
- docker_image - support ``platform`` when building images (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/22, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/54).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- docker_container - currently ``published_ports`` can contain port mappings next to the special value ``all``, in which case the port mappings are ignored. This behavior is deprecated for community.docker 2.0.0, at which point it will either be forbidden, or this behavior will be properly implemented similar to how the Docker CLI tool handles this (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/8, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/60).

Bugfixes
--------

- docker_image - if ``push=true`` is used with ``repository``, and the image does not need to be tagged, still push. This can happen if ``repository`` and ``name`` are equal (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/52, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/53).
- docker_image - report error when loading a broken archive that contains no image (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/46, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/55).
- docker_image - report error when the loaded archive does not contain the specified image (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/41, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/55).

New Plugins
-----------

Connection
~~~~~~~~~~

- docker_api - Run tasks in docker containers

~~~~~~~~~

- docker_containers - Ansible dynamic inventory plugin for Docker containers.

New Modules
-----------

- current_container_facts - Return facts about whether the module runs in a Docker container

v1.0.1
======

Release Summary
---------------

Maintenance release with a bugfix for ``docker_container``.

Bugfixes
--------

- docker_container - the validation for ``capabilities`` in ``device_requests`` was incorrect (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/42, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/43).

v1.0.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

This is the first production (non-prerelease) release of ``community.docker``.
