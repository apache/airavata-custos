Release Summary
---------------

Bugfix release. Fixes compatibility issue of ACME modules with step-ca.

Bugfixes
--------

- acme_* modules - avoid crashing for ACME servers where the ``meta`` directory key is not present (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/220, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/221).

v1.6.1
======

Release Summary
---------------

Bugfix release.

Bugfixes
--------

- acme_* modules - fix wrong usages of ``ACMEProtocolException`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/216, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/217).

v1.6.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Fixes compatibility issues with the latest ansible-core 2.11 beta, and contains a lot of internal refactoring for the ACME modules and support for private key passphrases for them.

Minor Changes
-------------

- acme module_utils - the ``acme`` module_utils has been split up into several Python modules (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/184).
- acme_* modules - codebase refactor which should not be visible to end-users (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/184).
- acme_* modules - support account key passphrases for ``cryptography`` backend (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/197, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/207).
- acme_certificate_revoke - support revoking by private keys that are passphrase protected for ``cryptography`` backend (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/207).
- acme_challenge_cert_helper - add ``private_key_passphrase`` parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/207).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- acme module_utils - the ``acme`` module_utils (``ansible_collections.community.crypto.plugins.module_utils.acme``) is deprecated and will be removed in community.crypto 2.0.0. Use the new Python modules in the ``acme`` package instead (``ansible_collections.community.crypto.plugins.module_utils.acme.xxx``) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/184).

v1.5.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Regular feature and bugfix release. Deprecates a return value.

Minor Changes
-------------

- acme_account_info - when ``retrieve_orders`` is not ``ignore`` and the ACME server allows to query orders, the new return value ``order_uris`` is always populated with a list of URIs (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/178).
- luks_device - allow to specify sector size for LUKS2 containers with new ``sector_size`` parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/193).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- acme_account_info - when ``retrieve_orders=url_list``, ``orders`` will no longer be returned in community.crypto 2.0.0. Use ``order_uris`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/178).

Bugfixes
--------

- openssl_csr - no longer fails when comparing CSR without basic constraint when ``basic_constraints`` is specified (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/179, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/180).

v1.4.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Release with several new features and bugfixes.

Minor Changes
-------------

- The ACME module_utils has been relicensed back from the Simplified BSD License (https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) to the GPLv3+ (same license used by most other code in this collection). This undoes a licensing change when the original GPLv3+ licensed code was moved to module_utils in https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40697 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/165).
- The ``crypto/identify.py`` module_utils has been renamed to ``crypto/pem.py`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/166).
- luks_device - ``new_keyfile``, ``new_passphrase``, ``remove_keyfile`` and ``remove_passphrase`` are now idempotent (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/19, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/168).
- luks_device - allow to configure PBKDF (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/163).
- openssl_csr, openssl_csr_pipe - allow to specify CRL distribution endpoints with ``crl_distribution_points`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/147, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/167).
- openssl_pkcs12 - allow to specify certificate bundles in ``other_certificates`` by using new option ``other_certificates_parse_all`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/149, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/166).

Bugfixes
--------

- acme_certificate - error when requested challenge type is not found for non-valid challenges, instead of hanging on step 2 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/171, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/173).

v1.3.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Contains new modules ``openssl_privatekey_pipe``, ``openssl_csr_pipe`` and ``x509_certificate_pipe`` which allow to create or update private keys, CSRs and X.509 certificates without having to write them to disk.


Minor Changes
-------------

- openssh_cert - add module parameter ``use_agent`` to enable using signing keys stored in ssh-agent (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/116).
- openssl_csr - refactor module to allow code re-use by openssl_csr_pipe (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/123).
- openssl_privatekey - refactor module to allow code re-use by openssl_privatekey_pipe (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/119).
- openssl_privatekey - the elliptic curve ``secp192r1`` now triggers a security warning. Elliptic curves of at least 224 bits should be used for new keys; see `here <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/ec.html#elliptic-curves>`_ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/132).
- x509_certificate - for the ``selfsigned`` provider, a CSR is not required anymore. If no CSR is provided, the module behaves as if a minimal CSR which only contains the public key has been provided (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/32, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/129).
- x509_certificate - refactor module to allow code re-use by x509_certificate_pipe (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/135).

Bugfixes
--------

- openssl_pkcs12 - report the correct state when ``action`` is ``parse`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/143).
- support code - improve handling of certificate and certificate signing request (CSR) loading with the ``cryptography`` backend when errors occur (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/138, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/139).
- x509_certificate - fix ``entrust`` provider, which was broken since community.crypto 0.1.0 due to a feature added before the collection move (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/135).

New Modules
-----------

- openssl_csr_pipe - Generate OpenSSL Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
- openssl_privatekey_pipe - Generate OpenSSL private keys without disk access
- x509_certificate_pipe - Generate and/or check OpenSSL certificates

Minor Changes
-------------

- luks_device - accept ``passphrase``, ``new_passphrase`` and ``remove_passphrase``.
- luks_device - add ``keysize`` parameter to set key size at LUKS container creation

- openssl_* modules - the cryptography backend now properly supports ``dirName``, ``otherName`` and ``RID`` (Registered ID) names.
- openssl_certificate - Add option for changing which ACME directory to use with acme-tiny. Set the default ACME directory to Let's Encrypt instead of using acme-tiny's default. (acme-tiny also uses Let's Encrypt at the time being, so no action should be neccessary.)
- openssl_certificate - Change the required version of acme-tiny to >= 4.0.0

Bugfixes
--------

- ACME modules: fix bug in ACME v1 account update code
- ACME modules: make sure some connection errors are handled properly
- ACME modules: support Buypass' ACME v1 endpoint
- acme_certificate - fix crash when module is used with Python 2.x.
- acme_certificate - fix misbehavior when ACME v1 is used with ``modify_account`` set to ``false``.
- ecs_certificate - Always specify header ``connection: keep-alive`` for ECS API connections.
- ecs_certificate - Fix formatting of contents of ``full_chain_path``.
- get_certificate - Fix cryptography backend when pyopenssl is unavailable (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67900)
- openssh_keypair - add logic to avoid breaking password protected keys.
- openssh_keypair - fixes idempotence issue with public key (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64969).
