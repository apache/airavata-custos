    description:
      - The name of the imported file is specified directly without any other option.
      - Most keywords, including loops and conditionals, only applied to the imported tasks, not to this statement itself.
      - If you need any of those to apply, use M(ansible.builtin.include_tasks) instead.
notes:
  - This is a core feature of Ansible, rather than a module, and cannot be overridden like a module.
