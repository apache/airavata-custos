module: gather_facts
version_added: 2.8
short_description: Gathers facts about remote hosts
description:
     - This module takes care of executing the configured facts modules, the default is to use the M(ansible.builtin.setup) module.
     - This module is automatically called by playbooks to gather useful variables about remote hosts that can be used in playbooks.
     - It can also be executed directly by C(/usr/bin/ansible) to check what variables are available to a host.
     - Ansible provides many I(facts) about the system, automatically.
options:
    parallel:
        description:
            - A toggle that controls if the fact modules are executed in parallel or serially and in order.
              This can guarantee the merge order of module facts at the expense of performance.
            - By default it will be true if more than one fact module is used.
        type: bool
notes:
    - This module is mostly a wrapper around other fact gathering modules.
    - Options passed to this module must be supported by all the underlying fact modules configured.
    - Facts returned by each module will be merged, conflicts will favor 'last merged'.
      Order is not guaranteed, when doing parallel gathering on multiple modules.
